# CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery.

# It’s a web security vulnerability where a malicious 
# website tricks a user’s browser into sending an unauthorized 
# request to a trusted website where the user is already authenticated.

# Simple idea

# If you are logged in to a website (like a bank or social media),
# your browser automatically sends cookies with every request.

# An attacker abuses this behavior.

# How CSRF works (step by step)

# You log in to a trusted site (e.g., bank.com)

# Your browser stores an authentication cookie

# You visit a malicious website

# That website secretly sends a request to bank.com

# Your browser automatically attaches your cookies

# The server thinks you sent the request

# 👉 Result: an action is performed without your consent
# What CSRF can do
    # Change passwords
    # Transfer money
    # Delete accounts
    # Update user settings

# The main solution (the only one you really need)
# ✅ CSRF Token

# Think of it like a secret password for each form/request.
